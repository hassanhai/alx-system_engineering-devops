Postmortem: Web Stack Outage Incident

Issue Summary:
Duration:

Start Time: january 22, 2024, 09:30 AM (UTC)

End Time: january 22, 2024, 11:45 AM (UTC)

Impact:

The outage affected the core authentication service, rendering user logins and account access unavailable for 30% of our user base. Users experienced authentication errors and were unable to perform actions requiring authentication during the incident.


Root Cause:

The root cause was identified as a misconfiguration in the authentication service database connection pool settings, leading to a rapid depletion of available connections.

Timeline:

09:30 AM: Issue detected through monitoring alerts indicating a sudden spike in authentication errors.

09:35 AM: Investigation initiated by the operations team to identify the source of the increased error rate.

09:50 AM: Initial assumption made that the issue was related to network connectivity or database performance. Network logs and database metrics analyzed.

10:15 AM: Misleading investigation path as database metrics showed no signs of performance degradation. Focus shifted towards load balancer configuration.

10:40 AM: Issue escalated to the database team as load balancer configuration appeared normal. Database team identified the connection pool misconfiguration as the likely cause.

11:00 AM: Corrective action taken to adjust the authentication service database connection pool settings.

11:45 AM: Service fully restored after the corrective action, and monitoring confirmed a significant reduction in authentication errors.

Root Cause and Resolution:

Root Cause: The misconfiguration in the authentication service database connection pool settings led to an excessive number of open connections, causing the database to reject new connection attempts and resulting in authentication errors for users.

Resolution: The issue was resolved by promptly adjusting the connection pool settings to ensure a proper balance between connection availability and resource utilization. This adjustment prevented the rapid depletion of connections and restored normal operation of the authentication service.

Corrective and Preventative Measures:

Improvements/Fixes:

1. Conduct a comprehensive review of all critical service configurations to identify and address potential misconfigurations.

2. Implement additional monitoring for connection pool usage and set up automated alerts for abnormal patterns.

Tasks to Address the Issue:

1. Schedule regular configuration reviews for critical services, focusing on potential points of failure.

2. Enhance documentation regarding database connection pool settings to facilitate quicker diagnosis and resolution of similar issues in the future.

3. Conduct a post-incident review with the operations and database teams to share insights and improve collaboration in handling similar incidents.

4. Explore the possibility of implementing automated rollback procedures for critical configurations to minimize downtime during corrective actions.

Conclusion
This postmortem provides a detailed account of the outage incident, its impact, the timeline of detection and resolution, the root cause, and the measures taken to prevent a recurrence. Through this analysis, we aim to improve our systemâ€™s resilience and response mechanisms, ensuring a more robust and reliable service for our users.
